   <h1>Hi!, I'm Harvey and I like to collect old computers.</h1>
   <p>

	<p>The latest addition to my collection, this is an old early 2003 iMac G4 boasting a blazing fast single core 800 megahertz PPC G4 proccesor, and a whopping 512 mbs of RAM.</p>
	<p>I picked this one up from the music teacher at my high-school, pretty random right? Whats even wirder is the fact that multiple files say it was last used in june of 2003, meaning that the school bought new 2000 dollar computers and only used them for half a year.</p>
	<p>Now even though the G4 is over 20 years old I was supprised of how modern you could make the machine, through a little bit of elbo-grease (And DosDude1's software) I was able to get Mac OSX 10.5 installed and get this, browse the internet! Which if you put it like that sounds not so special but trust me old computers have the hardest time even getting the most basic of web-pages to load and most don't even support HTTPS which most sites use now adays.</p>

	<p>And here it is, the first ever iMac. Probobly one of Apple's most recognizable products that not only saved the company but brought back Steve Jobs as CEO and what some might agure changed the course of computing.</p>
	<p>Otherwise known as the iMac G3 this model comes from 2001 and utilizes a 700 megaheartz PPC G3 the main difference this computer has to the G4 is the massive CRT display instead of an LCD.</p>
	<p>Unfortuanatly this is not the first iMac G3 I've owned, a few months ago I picked up a 1998 revision B iMac G3 from a local thriftshop suprisingly it worked perfectly! Untill it didn't, you see I was trying to upgrade the RAM and HDD in the computer by swaping out the old soon to fail 60 Gb Harddrive with a brand new 512gb SSD and install 1 GB of RAM, if done susscesfully this would make the iMac G3 run so much faster and improve the overall experence, however (And I'm still not to sure why) the computer just wont start any longer first it wouldent even turn on at all, then after some adjustments it does turn on but only with a flashing orange light on the power button. I tried to fix it to the best of my abilities but seriosly cant find a single thing wrong with it, so for now it's taken apart just sitting on a table, currently I'm trying to find a person that might be more qualified then me to fix it but due to the age of these machines that's easier said then done.</p>
